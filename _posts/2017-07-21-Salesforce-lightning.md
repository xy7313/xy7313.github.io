1. Lightning apps let you brand your apps with a custom color and logo. You can even include a utility bar and Lightning page tabs in your Lightning app. They also give your users access to sets of objects, tabs, and other items all in one convenient bundle in the navigation bar.

    - Most standard objects, including Home, the main Chatter feed, Groups,and People
    - Your org’s custom objects
    - Visualforce tabs
    - Lightning component tabs
    - Canvas apps via Visualforce tabs
    - Web tabs
    - Lightning page tabs and utilities like Lightning Voice

3. Tips for Creating **Apps** in Lightning Experience
    - Talk to your users. Ask them what their priorities are. 
    - Customizing tabs in apps gives you a unique opportunity to engage with your users. 
    - Each group of users has its own priorities. Find out which objects and items represent their highest priorities.
    - Ask users to post feedback to a chatter group

    - Compact layouts control the fields your users see in the highlights panel at the top of a record and the fields that appear in the expanded lookup card you see when you hover over a link in record details.(shows on one page but set on different object compact layout)

8. Customize **Record details** with page layouts using Page layout editor:
    - Control which fields(and order of fields), lists of related records, and custom links users see
    - Determine whether fields are visible, read only, or required
    - Control which quick actions appear on the page

    - is the go-to place for customizing a Lightning Experience record page’s fields and related lists.
    - has two basic parts: a palette on the upper portion of the screen and the record’s page layout on the lower portion of the screen.
    - This Highlights Panel section in the page layout editor controls the highlights panel on pages in our Classic UI. It’s of no use to us in Lightning Experience.
