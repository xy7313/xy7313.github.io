[tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AbaV3nrw6E&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBuKtLgPR_zWYnrwv-JllpA&index=1)

1. download code:  https://github.com/buckyroberts/React-Boilerplate
2. include 
```
//after download, also can ref online file
<script src="../../js/react.min.js"></script>
<script src="../../js/react-dom.min.js"></script>
<script src="../../js/browser.min.js"></script>
```

The last line transpile jsx file to plain js file so that browser can understand jsx. There are also some online tools can do the same work for developer.
