##### 1. Quick start: Create the Trailblazer App -- salesforce classic
1. Intro: build an app, which helps you on your personal journey to your local park — by keeping track of the places you want to go and the things you want to see. When you complete this quick start, you’ll have a working app with its own menu, a tab, and a custom object that tracks the names of places you want to visit.
1. When we want to build an app on the salesforce platform, there is a bunch of built-in functionality, such as:
    1. Database to organize information
    2. Security for protecting data and defining access across your organization
    3. Business logic to carry out particular tasks under certain conditions
    4. User interface to expose data and functionality
    5. Highly customizable mobile app
    6. Native social environment that allows you to interact with people or data
    7. Analytics and dashboards for viewing your data in meaningful ways
    8. Multiple APIs to integrate with external systems
    9. Ability to install or create third-party apps
2. When you create an app, you automatically create a data object. In Salesforce, we call that data object a custom object.（sheet/table）
3. Custom object:
    1. A custom object comes with standard fields and screens that allow you to list, view, and edit information about the object
    2. you can also add your own fields to track or list just about anything you can think of.
4. When you create an app with App Cloud, you automatically create a mobile version of the app.
5. For mobile app, Quick Actions are things you want to do immediately from your mobile device. These actions live in a special place called the Publisher. You can customize the Publisher so that your most important actions are there at your fingertips.
6. Salesforce has two different user interfaces: Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic
7. Standard fields(after create new waypoint, we can see):
    1. Feed — The Chatter feed is where you see things you're interested in, like people, records, and groups. You can customize the feed to see exactly what you want to follow.
    2. Details — The ‘tab’-Waypoint custom object has four fields, the Name (I created) and three fields generated by the system (Created By, Owner, Last Modified By). As you build out your app, you can add more fields to refine the things you want to track.
    3. Activities — Activities are tasks and events associated with this record. Tasks are to-do items, and events are meetings. We don't go into Activities in this quick start, but keep it in mind, because it's a handy and powerful feature that you'll love.

8. Steps:
    1. Add APP
    2. Fill in the form( Plural Lable: pl of Lable)
    3. Create --> go to My App
    4. Create items of a tab 
    5. Change the heart symbol: Setup --> Create --> Tabs --> Edit
    6. For mobile: 
        1. create quick action: create --> global actions --> global actions --> new action --> target object: your tab name( waypoint )
        2. add that Quick Action to the Publisher:  Create --> Global Actions --> Publisher Layouts --> drag(Remove action by dragging it up to the Global Layout area, add action by dragging it from the Global Layout and dropping it into the Global Publisher below.)
        3. /one/one.app

##### 2. Quick start: Create a New Process on the Account Object -- lightening process builder
1. Intro: Lightning Process Builder is a workflow tool that helps automate business processes without writing a single line of code. This quick start creates a new process that updates Contact records whenever the Account billing address changes
2. Process Builder allows you to choose not just fields on Accounts, but fields that are related to Accounts.
3. you could add multiple actions for one criteria.
8. Steps:
    1. Search builder and select process builder --> click new -->type name --> when start: a record changes --> save --> +add project
    2. Process Criteria： 
    3. Process Action: 

##### 3. TRY TRAIL: Admin Beginner
1. CRM : a place to store your customer data, processes to nurture and convert prospective customers, and ways to collaborate and engage
2. Salesforce is CRM, it also includes the platform, where customers and partners can use our suite of technologies to build amazing, connected apps.
3. Terminology
    1. Record: an item you are tracking in your database -- a row on the spreadsheet.
    2. Field: a place where you store a value, like a name or address -- a column on the spreadsheet.
    3. Object: a table in the database -- a tab on the spreadsheet
    4. Org: short for "Organization", the place where all your data, configuration, and customization lives -- your instance of Salesforce. you and your user log in to access it.
    5. Force.com: The suite of configuration tools and programming languages, and APIs native to Salesforce, including Apex and Visualforce
    6. App: A set of fields, objects, permissions, and functionality to support a business process. Not a thing you download onto your phone.
        1. example: if you’re having an event and you want people to sign in,  you could create an Event app in Salesforce. The process/entity becomes an object (‘Event’), and those columns become fields (‘Attendee Name’, ‘Title’, ‘Company’, ‘Email’) on the object.
        2. benefits:
            - Get real-time access to data as it’s entered, via mobile or desktop.
            - Create reports and dashboards to analyze attendees.
            - Send follow up emails to attendees after the event.
            - Relate attendees to marketing campaigns and sales information including order and purchase information.
            - Engage with attendees in a community.
            - Create automated processes to engage with the attendees over time.
            - Take advantage of instant scalability, instant mobile access, secure data storage and backups.
            - And much, much more
4. An example using platform:
    1. scenario:
    2. solution: create a custom field for preferred phone number, and add a new section on the page layout [1] just for phone numbers and your new custom field.
4. define declarative and programmatic development：
    1. Declarative refers to point-and-click functionality in Salesforce. It means that you can configure and customize Salesforce without writing code.
    2. Programmatic refers to code-driven functionality in Salesforce. It means that you can customize Salesforce using programmatic tools like Apex, Visualforce, and Lightning, and standard web technologies like JavaScript, CSS, and more.
5. the golden rule is to always try to build with clicks before going to code, as it is more sustainable and maintainable moving forward.
6. tips for identifying good processes to bring onto the platform
    1. reliance on spreadsheets
    2. Collaboration via email
    3. Documents shared on local file directories
    4. Time-intensive, manual steps
    5. Impact to a few departments maximum (just as you’re getting started; keeping your number of stakeholders to a minimum will help you make progress)
