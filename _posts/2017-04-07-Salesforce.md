##### Concepts about salesforce
1. Salesforce has two different user interfaces: Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic

##### 1. Quick start: Create the Trailblazer App -- salesforce classic
1. When you complete this quick start, you’ll have a working app with its own menu, a tab, and a custom object that tracks the names of places you want to visit.
1. When we want to build an app on the salesforce platform, there is a bunch of built-in functionality, such as:
    1. Database to organize information
    2. Security for protecting data and defining access across your organization
    3. Business logic to carry out particular tasks under certain conditions
    4. User interface to expose data and functionality
    5. Highly customizable mobile app
    6. Native social environment that allows you to interact with people or data
    7. Analytics and dashboards for viewing your data in meaningful ways
    8. Multiple APIs to integrate with external systems
    9. Ability to install or create third-party apps
2. When you create an app, you automatically create a data object. In Salesforce, we call that data object a custom object.（sheet/table）
3. Custom object:
    1. A custom object comes with standard fields and screens that allow you to list, view, and edit information about the object
    2. you can also add your own fields to track or list just about anything you can think of.
4. When you create an app with App Cloud, you automatically create a mobile version of the app.
5. For mobile app, Quick Actions are things you want to do immediately from your mobile device. These actions live in a special place called the Publisher. You can customize the Publisher so that your most important actions are there at your fingertips.

6. Steps:
    1. Add APP
    2. Fill in the form( Plural Lable: pl of Lable)
    3. Create --> go to My App
    4. Create items of a tab
    5. Change the heart symbol: Setup --> Create --> Tabs --> Edit

##### 2. Quick start: Create a New Process on the Account Object -- lightening process builder
